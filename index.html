      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Prior to the start of Covid, I could have described my family, and life in general, as wonderful. Life was good. I often found myself smiling when thinking of how lucky we were. Then covid struck. Shortly thereafter my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He was told he had only a year left if he started chemotherapy right away. That was over a year and a half ago. Since that time, my family has gone through a roller coaster of emotions, heartbreaks, set-backs, and moments of pure joy. It has been the hardest time of our lives. About 2 months ago it became evident that the chemotherapy was no longer working to control the spread and growth of my husband's tumors; the cancer had spread. Over the last couple months my husband has developed more cancerous lesions and growth in old ones. He struggles to eat and digest food. He has aged 20 years in a matter of 20 months. This is our life now, and the main reason I am in this program. I needed a diversion, a purpose, and a reason to get up every morning.</p>
      <p>I don't know what is ahead or what the future has in store for me and my kids. I just feel that I need to trust that I am heading in the right direction. I have to believe that I am making progress towards being the best mother I can be for my kids while also preparing to be the sole provider for them. I have learned so much over the past few months. I feel overwhelmed sometimes when I think about all I still have to learn. Yet, when I look back and see how far I have come and what I can do today in comparison to what I could not do last fall, I am filled with hope that I can do this! </p>

    <h2 id="goals"; style="padding: 50px 0;">My Education and Goals</h2>
    <p> I am working towards a Master's Degree in Web Design and Mass Communication. After this spring semester comes to an end, I will have successfully completed four courses. It has been challenging but also so exhilarating to be back in school and learning! I love learning! As I progress through this program my ideas of what I might do with this education are changing slightly. I believe that will be the case all the way until the end, so I am not sure what my career goals are just yet. I do see myself creating websites, maybe not from scratch, but definitely with the use of tools and building blocks. </p>
    <p>I entered this program with a criminal justice background. I had spent several years working in law enforcment and with juvenile services before deciding I prefered working with young children and in a capacity that allowed me to be artistic and expressive. I am able to get my fill of these things through my position as a teaching assistant while also allowing me enough time to pursue other goals. I am hopeful that I will be able to balance all the things I would like to do in the future while still maintaining my sanity.</p>

          <p>I designed my Irish Dance school's website several years ago and have maintained it ever since. I know it isn't perfect, but I am proud of how good it looks and performs. It is by far one of the best Irish dance school websites out there. I have been asked to redesign this site by June or July to accommodate the needs of the growing school.</p>

          <p>Running my portrait studio was my full-time job for years prior to my husband's diagnosis. However, since the big "C" became part of our family, I have had a hard time finding the desire to continue running my business. I have a large porfolio of beautiful work I produced over the years to be proud of, and I may return to this eventually. But for now, I am slowing down in this area.</p>

      <div class="row" style="padding-top: 25px">
        <p> I began my career in photography in my 20's. I spent several years in the US Navy as a Photographer's Mate and later a Mass Communication Specialist. It wasn't until late 2014 that I opened my own business. I was immediately drawn to working with newborns and found working with them came naturally to me. I grew my business through the first couple of years until it became necessary to have a studio space. We then bought a home that had ample space for a dedicated studio and I have been working out of it successfully ever since.</p>
        <p>Below is a small example of some of my recent portrait work.</p>

          <p>My favorite hobbies are craft or art related. I love painting, creative digital editing, crocheting, knitting, and embroidery. I also love hiking and exploring new locations. I love beach combing and shoreline exploring. If I could live anywhere it would for sure be along the coast near a beach. I like doing puzzles and crosswords too.</p>
